# 📌 Problem Statement

The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic optimization problem where the objective is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city.

In this project, we solve the TSP using Google OR-Tools and visualize the optimized path with Matplotlib.
